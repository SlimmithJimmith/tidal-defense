Tidal Defense Game Project 

Hi all. I linked everything in the discord server that I utilized. I installed Java 25 for this and am using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate (can get for free through school acct). 
Additionally, we are using LibGDX game engine with 2d box physics engine as well as default GUI interface extension to create basic textures and skins to make creation of game easier instead of doing everything from scratch (which would be impossible given our skillsets currently).
